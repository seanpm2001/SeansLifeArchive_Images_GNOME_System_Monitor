# My May 2021 GNOME System Monitor recap

This directory contains my GNOME System Monitor end of day recap pictures from May 2021.

May 2021 is my 9th consecutive month getting these screenshots on a daily basis.

I started getting these screenshots daily on September 19th 2020. Before this, it was only done for events.

It turned into a daily tradition from this point onward.

## Some notes

1. I got screenshots for this month from May 1st 2021 to May 1st 2021 (As of May 1st 2021)

2. Screenshots for this month are in 1920x1200 resolution

3. These pictures are of the GNOME System Monitor on Linux/Ubuntu 20.04 with the GNOME 3.36.1 desktop environment.

4. Dark theme is used by default. I do not offer light mode screenshots at the moment.

5. Images are in PNG format

6. I take these pictures at the end of the day before shutting my laptop down. Sometimes pictures will be taken before system restarts, or to document a hard drive backup

7. Every once in a while, I change the color of the CPU, RAM, and network graphs.

8. This month (as of May 1st 2021) screenshots were taken on my laptop clone, as my main laptop broke down.

9. No other notes for this month
