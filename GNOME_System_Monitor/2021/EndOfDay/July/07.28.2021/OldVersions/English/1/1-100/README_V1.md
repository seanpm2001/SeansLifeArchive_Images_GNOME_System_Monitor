# Data unavailable

## July 28th 2021

Data for today is unavailable, as I forgot to get screenshots of the System Monitor today (other than battery milestone screenshots) for close matches for today, see [here (https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_Battery/tree/master/Battery/NormalEstimates/1/AAAA)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_Battery/tree/master/Battery/NormalEstimates/1/AAAA). The number of As is the number of months, I intend to have it as a running joke, where eventually, it is just going to be a wall of A's, and maybe get on the [r/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa](https://www.reddit.com/r/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/) subreddit and similar communities. The A is in reference to A batteries, AA (double A) batteries, AAA (triple A) batteries, and so on.
