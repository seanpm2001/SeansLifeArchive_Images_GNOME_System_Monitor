# My June 2021 GNOME System Monitor recap

This directory contains my GNOME System Monitor end of day recap pictures from June 2021.

June 2021 is my 10th consecutive month of me getting these screenshots on a daily basis.

I started getting these screenshots daily on September 19th 2020. Before this, it was only done for events.

It turned into a daily tradition from this point onward.

My 1 year anniversary of switching to Linux is coming up on July 9th 2021. This is a key project in the 1 year Linux celebration.

## Some notes

1. I got screenshots for this month from June 1st 2021 to June 1st 2021 (As of June 1st 2021)

2. Screenshots for this month are in 1920x1200 resolution

3. These pictures are of the GNOME System Monitor on Linux/Ubuntu 20.04 with the GNOME 3.36.1 desktop environment.

4. Dark theme is used by default. I do not offer light mode screenshots at the moment.

5. Images are in PNG format

6. I take these pictures at the end of the day before shutting my laptop down. Sometimes pictures will be taken before system restarts, or to document a hard drive backup

7. Every once in a while, I change the color of the CPU, RAM, and network graphs.

8. I now get progress screenshots throughout the day, so I don't lose network data through crashes

9. On May 31st 2021, I switched the network to display in bits, and also to have a 3D CPU graph, which is much easier for me to process. I also enabled all file systems, I found out alot about the program on this day.

10. This month (as of June 1st 2021) screenshots were taken on my main laptop, as I got back to it after a system failure caused by a hardware problem. It took me over a month to come back.

11. No other notes for this month
